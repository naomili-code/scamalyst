      <h2>About ScamSensei</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>My Community Work</h3>
        <p>For the past two years, I have served as a Tech Tutor through a program at the William K. Sanford Town Library, where I work one-on-one with community members to help them navigate modern technology. Most of the people I assist are elderly individuals and immigrants who did not grow up with today’s digital tools and often feel overwhelmed by rapid technological change.</p>
        <p>In each session, I help with practical issues such as using phones, recognizing suspicious emails, navigating websites, and understanding how to safely interact with online platforms. This role requires patience, adaptability, and the ability to explain complex technological concepts in ways that are clear and accessible, regardless of someone’s prior experience.</p>

        <h3>What I Saw and Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>Through this experience, I noticed a consistent and concerning pattern: nearly every person I worked with struggled to identify what was safe or unsafe online, and what information was real or illegitimate. Many showed me scam emails pretending to be from banks, fake pop-up warnings claiming their devices were infected, or messages designed to create urgency and fear.</p>
        <p>What stood out most was not just the technical issue, but the uncertainty and vulnerability they felt. Technology, which is meant to empower people, was instead becoming a source of confusion and risk. That made me realize how critical digital literacy and cybersecurity education are, especially for vulnerable populations who are often targeted.</p>

        <h3>How My Passion Evolved</h3>
        <p>My passion for this work comes from a long-standing interest in coding and cybersecurity. As I learned more about how technology works behind the scenes, I became fascinated not only with how systems are built, but also with how they can be exploited.</p>
        <p>Understanding both sides gave me a deeper appreciation for digital safety. But that passion became personal when I started working directly with community members and saw real people facing real risks. I realized my skills could be used not just to create technology, but to protect people.</p>

        <h3>Why I Built ScamSensei</h3>
        <p>ScamSensei was built to make cybersecurity education practical, accessible, and empowering for everyday users. Instead of only warning people, it explains red flags in messages and websites so users can build long-term confidence and safer habits online.</p>
        <p>It reflects what I learned as a tutor: people don’t need fear—they need tools that are clear, respectful, and useful in real life.</p>

        <h3>What This Experience Changed</h3>
        <p>This role shaped my goals by showing me that technology is most meaningful when it serves others. It inspired me to use my technical skills to educate, protect, and empower my community.</p>
        <p>Whether through tutoring individuals or building tools that help people identify scams, I am driven by the belief that everyone deserves to feel confident and safe in the digital world.</p>
