          <h3>Where This Started</h3>
          <p>For the past two years, I have served as a Tech Tutor through a local town library program, working one-on-one with community members to navigate modern technology and stay safe online.</p>
          <p>Many people I support—especially older adults and immigrants—feel overwhelmed by how quickly digital tools change and worry about scams. Seeing that same fear again and again inspired me to build Scamalyst: a simple tool that explains red flags in plain language and helps people make safer choices with confidence.</p>

          <h3>What I Help With</h3>
          <p>I help with practical tasks like using phones, recognizing suspicious emails, navigating websites, and interacting safely online.</p>
          <p>That work requires patience and clear communication so complex concepts make sense regardless of someone’s tech background.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="about-story-card">
          <h3>The Pattern I Kept Seeing</h3>
          <p>Nearly every person I supported struggled to identify what was safe online and what was fraudulent.</p>
          <p>People regularly showed scam emails impersonating banks, fake pop-up virus warnings, and urgent messages designed to trigger fear.</p>

        <article class="about-story-card">
          <h3>Why It Became Personal</h3>
          <p>My interest in coding and cybersecurity started with curiosity about how systems are built—and how attackers exploit them.</p>
          <p>Working directly with real people turned that curiosity into responsibility: I wanted to build tools that protect, not just tools that impress.</p>

          <h3>Why I Built Scamalyst</h3>
          <p>Scamalyst is designed to explain risks, not just label them. The goal is to help users build long-term confidence, not short-term panic.</p>
          <p>It was built so people can understand red flags in plain language and make safer choices in daily digital life.</p>
