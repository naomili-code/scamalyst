          <h3>Where This Started</h3>
          <p>For the past two years, I have served as a Tech Tutor through a local town library program, working one-on-one with community members to navigate modern technology. During each session, I support people with practical tasks like setting up devices, recognizing suspicious emails, securing accounts, and understanding how to use online services safely.</p>
          <p>Most people I help are elderly individuals and immigrants who did not grow up with today’s digital tools and often feel overwhelmed by how fast technology changes. Many are not lacking intelligence or effort—they simply have not been given clear, accessible guidance in a digital world that assumes everyone already knows the rules.</p>
          <p>Over time, I noticed the same fear repeatedly: people worried about clicking the wrong link, sharing the wrong information, or getting tricked by messages that look legitimate. That repeated experience is what inspired Scamalyst—to turn confusion into confidence through plain-language education and practical scam-awareness support.</p>

          <h3>What I Help With</h3>
          <p>I help with practical tasks like using phones, recognizing suspicious emails, navigating websites, and interacting safely online.</p>
          <p>That work requires patience and clear communication so complex concepts make sense regardless of someone’s tech background.</p>

        <article class="about-story-card">
          <h3>The Pattern I Kept Seeing</h3>
          <p>Nearly every person I supported struggled to identify what was safe online and what was fraudulent.</p>
          <p>People regularly showed scam emails impersonating banks, fake pop-up virus warnings, and urgent messages designed to trigger fear.</p>

          <h3>Why It Became Personal</h3>
          <p>My interest in coding and cybersecurity started with curiosity about how systems are built—and how attackers exploit them.</p>
          <p>Working directly with real people turned that curiosity into responsibility: I wanted to build tools that protect, not just tools that impress.</p>

          <h3>Why I Built Scamalyst</h3>
          <p>Scamalyst is designed to explain risks, not just label them. The goal is to help users build long-term confidence, not short-term panic.</p>
          <p>It was built so people can understand red flags in plain language and make safer choices in daily digital life.</p>
